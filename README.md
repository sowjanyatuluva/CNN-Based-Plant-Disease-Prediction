# CNN-Based-Plant-Disease-Prediction
This project focused on plant disease detection using the Inception V3 CNN architecture to help farmers manage crop health more effectively. We organized a database of various plant species and their diseases, then used image processing techniques to analyze plant health based on visual indicators like leaf spots.  

The model achieved 62% accuracy in disease detection, providing treatment recommendations to farmers. By leveraging Google’s GPU, we improved the speed and efficiency of the system, demonstrating how technology can address agricultural challenges. In the future, we plan to expand the dataset to include more plant species and diseases and integrate additional features like weather and soil conditions to further enhance predictions.
